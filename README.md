## APIs ##

## Misc ideas
- external links should open in new window, not redirect
- users can edit image covers, titles, etc
- users can delete books from shelf
- drag around to change order?
- show how many books are on the user's shelf, and how many 5 star / 4 star / 3 star etc ratings a user has given
- infinite scroll?
- stars overlapping book covers instead of diamond
- clean up fonts
- oauth?
- landing page
- proper navigation
- decide what happens when book review is too long.  Should be same as book description.  Scroll bar?  Truncate method?
- test and remove unnecessary css
- add validations for database?
- add logic for users with >200 books
- add more image sources?
- add option to select between images I pull automatically? -->
